Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
make you want to move your dancing feet
to the rescue, here i am
want you to know ya, where i stand

(monday morning) here i am
(tuesday evening) want you to know just if you can
where i stand
(wenesday morning)
tell myself a new day is rising
(thursday evening) get on the rise
a new day is dawning
(friday morning) here i am
(saturday evening) want you to know just
want you to know just where i stand

when the morning gathers the rainbow
want you to know i'm a rainbow too
so to the rescue here i am
want you to know just if you can
where i stand
